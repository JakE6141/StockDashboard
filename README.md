# Overview
The Stock Market Tracker is a Python application designed to provide users with real-time stock market data, including top gainers and losers, most actively traded stocks and weekly stock price charts. This project is my first Python project, and through its development, I aim to deepen my understanding of the language and its libraries, particularly in the context of API integration and graphical user interface creation.
# Features
* Search for stock symbols: User can search for any stock symbol and get back a comprehensive result with chart data, and other data below which gives more detail explaining dividends, highs, lows and price overall.
* Top gainers and losers: User can see top 20 gainers and 20 losers, as well as all the data(percent gain/loss etc...) provided with the stock symbol so they can enter that stock symbol as well for graphical visualization.
* Most actively traded stocks: Users can see the top 7 most traded stocks of that day with all data being shown for them. The user can use this data to enter it into the chart if they want to know more.
* Stock price chart: User can use this chart to visualize the stock they want to look into. This chart provides recent dates(x axis) and the closing price of the stock with the price shown on the y axis.
* API integration: Utilized Alpha Vantage stock API to get live time stock data and percent amounts related to each stock.
# Future Plans
* I want to drastically change the GUI since this was my first time using Tkinter I want to make the GUI look much more professional
* Adding more data to the chart with different color lines is also a feature I would want to give to the user for more data information and clarity.
